                    <p>The Triumph Spitfire is a small British two-seat sports car, introduced at the London Motor Show
                        in 1962[4] and manufactured between 1962 and 1980. The vehicle was based on a design produced
                        for Standard-Triumph in 1957 by Italian designer Giovanni Michelotti. The car was largely based
                        upon the chassis of the Triumph Herald saloon, but shortened and without the Herald's outrigger
                        sections. The Herald's running gear and Standard SC engine were also carried over. The Spitfire
                        was manufactured at the Standard-Triumph works at Canley, in Coventry.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The bodywork was fitted to a separate structural chassis, but for the open-top convertible
                        Spitfire the backbone chassis' rigidity was augmented by the use of structural components within
                        the bodywork, with the rear trailing arms being bolted to the body rather than the chassis. The
                        Spitfire was provided with a manual soft-top for weather protection, the design improving to a
                        folding hood for later models. Factory-manufactured hard-tops were also available.</p>
